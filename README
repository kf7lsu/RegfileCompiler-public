This tool is used to generate register files of varying sizes.

The src folder contains the tcl, verilog, and python source files used to
generate the register files. Additonally, that is where the makefile is
located. A few of the scripts in src require modification to adapt to a new
process node. The README files in each level clarify which files need
modification.

The run folder is where the tool is run, all the intermediate files are
generated there and the result is found there as well.

NOTE: This tool heavily uses symbolic links and has only been tested on CentOS
      7.9.2009
