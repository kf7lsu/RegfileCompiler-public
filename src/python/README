To adapt this tool to a process node, a few things need to happen in this
folder.

1. Modify cell_map.py to have the correct cell names for your process node

2. Adjust the gate sizing algorithms in size_buffers_latches.py. The values for upsizing gates depend on the process node and the number of entries in the register file.

3. Modify customPlacement.py to have the standard cell heights be the heights used in your library.

4. Edit the parseModule.py algorithms to parse correctly using the correct cell names used in your design.
